# CodeFights Solutions

These are my solutions for the CodeFights exercises. Currently, the solutions will be written in JavaScript. Eventually, I would like to add solutions for PHP, C, and possibly Python and Java. I may also add solutions in Ruby, Perl, C#, or other languages because CodeFights is a great way to get comfortable with a new language.

## Goals:
 - Finish adding Intro solutions
 - Add Interview and other Arcade solutions
 - Add comments to solutions to explain reasoning
 - Add solutions in PHP
 - Add solutions in C
 
 ## Possible Goals
 - Add psuedocode solutions
 - Add solutions in Python
 - Add solutions in Java
 - Add solutions in a new language like Ruby, Perl, C#, etc.
 
I've found that CodeFights has been a great resource for getting comfortable with a language. I tend to jump around with languages so syntax kills me. Also, CodeFights is fun. It's like playing a video game but I don't feel like I'm wasting time.
